Stream Source
// Streams can be created from Collections, Lists, Sets, ints, longs, doubles, arrays, lines of a file

Intermediate Operations
// Zero or more intermediate operations are allowed
// Order matters for large datasets: filter first, the sort or map

// For very large datasets use ParallelStream to enable multiple threads

// Intermediate operations include:
anymatch()
distinct()
filter()
findFirst()
flatmap()
map()
skip()
sorted()

Terminal Operations
// One terminal operation is allowed
// forEach applies the same function to each element.
// collect saves the elements into a collection
// other options reduce the stream to a single summary element.
